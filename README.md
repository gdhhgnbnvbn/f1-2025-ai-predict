## About the Project

The **F1 2025 AI Predict** project aims to provide insightful predictions using historical data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing past performance and race conditions, the AI generates predictions that can help teams strategize for the upcoming season. The model uses a variety of data points including driver performance, weather conditions, and circuit characteristics.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Predictions**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to forecast race outcomes.
- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulates individual driver behavior under various conditions.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Incorporates extensive historical data for improved accuracy.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit for real-time data visualization.
- **CSV Data Handling**: Easily import and export data for seamless integration.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a range of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing algorithms and data handling.
- **AI Agents**: Claude 3.5 for generating insights and predictions.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web application to visualize results.
- **CSV**: Used for data storage and manipulation.
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques for predictive modeling and analysis.

## Getting Started
